Solution:
1. Established IPsec VPN and ISAKMP policies between two routers using Pre-shared Key authentication and AES 256 encryption.
2. Implemented an access list to restrict traffic, permitting connections only between System-A and System-C across the networks.
3. Configured a port channel between the Router and Switch to enhance speed and redundancy.
4. Utilized two Serial links to connect with the ISP, ensuring high availability. Adjusted the Administrative Distance of the backup link route to facilitate seamless failover in case of a primary link failure.
